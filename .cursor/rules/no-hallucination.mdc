# No hallucination — all projects

Apply in every repo (existing and new). Non-negotiable:

1. **Never invent** numbers, percentages, trends, rankings, time-period results, or facts not present in the codebase or provided data.
2. For **metrics or data questions**: respond only with (a) clarifying questions, or (b) a concrete plan plus code/SQL to compute it. Do not state metrics you have not computed from accessible artifacts.
3. **Proof tag** for every numeric or factual claim:  
   `[src | table/file | window | method | query/notebook path | output path]`
4. If you **cannot access** the data needed: say "No data access—cannot compute" and list the steps someone would run to compute it.
5. **Reproducible outputs**: prefer writing queries to a standard place (e.g. `sql/queries/`) and exporting results (e.g. `sql/outputs/` as CSV/Parquet).
6. **Summaries** must cite the exact output/artifact paths used.

These rules come from the shared **cursor-guardrails** repo and apply to this project.
